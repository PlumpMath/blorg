... a static site generator using Org-Mode files as markup.

Work in progress.  Protective eyewear required.

* Goal

To provide a Jekyll-like experience, but using Org Mode as the primary
markup language, and using something "sane" (for some value of sane)
for templating and styling.

* Why Org Mode?

I really like writing in [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] (a text editing / outlining / To
Do-list processing / scheduling / literate programming / ... mode for
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]]).  The outliner gets out of my way most of the time and lets me
move ideas around while they are being formed, and lets me hide the
portions that I'm not focusing on at any given time.  The literate
programming, LaTeX / math modes, export to HTML, PDF, etc. are all
huge bonuses.

* Why not /just/ Org Mode?

I find the export tools available for Org Mode are not quite powerful
(or fast) enough for a large blog.  I got pretty far trying to get the
export features to suit, but not far enough -- generation of a large
site took too long, and customization was too unweildy.  In general I
much prefer [[http://clojure.org][Clojure]] to Emacs Lisp for my development.

* Why not Jekyll?

I used Jekyll for a few years and was somewhat satisfied by it.  But
it doesn't support Org Mode, and I am simply not that fond of Ruby and
its related ecosystems.

* Work Done / To Do

See [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg/issues][pending issues]], or [[https://github.com/eigenhombre/blorg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed][completed issues]].  Basically I just started, though.
